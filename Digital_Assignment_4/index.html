<h2>Monster Kombat</h2>
<ul>
<li><strong>Originality:</strong>
My game is unique because it combines a fighting-style game with our favorite sponge.  <br><br>

</li>

<li><strong>Technical Merit:</strong>
As for technical merit, although the structure of the game is rather basic, I was able to successfully create a turn-based fighting game. The game also has strong audio and visual elements.
<br><br>
</li>

<li><strong>Prototype Postmortem:</strong>
I learned several things from this prototype: how to effectively create a turn-based game, how to move images through the x and y axis, and how to more properly use helper functions outside of create() and update() <br><br>

</li>

<li><strong>Prototype Assets:</strong>
Assets for the game were not made from scratch, and instead borrowed from a variety of sources.
<ul>
<li>Character Images: <a href="https://pngtree.com/">PNG Tree</a></li>
<li>All sound effects: <a href="https://www.voicy.network/official-soundboards/">Sound Effects</a></li>
<li>I am unable to find the exact source of my original background image, but it was modified to include the name of the game.  The font that was used was sourced from Google Fonts.</li>
</ul>
<br>
</li>

<li><strong>Prototype Closest Other Game:</strong>
This time around, I did not directly pull aspects from a specific game; rather, I tried to create a game in the fighting genre.  This particular game could be related to something like Mortal Kombat.  All code was original and no existing codebase was used.  
<br><br>
</li>

<li><strong>High Concept:</strong>
In Monster Kombat, Spongebob meets an enemy that is not from his world.   Who will win this battle of epic proportions?
<br><br>
</li>

<li><strong>Challenge:</strong>
"Randomize": Damage from each character is completely random and not based on the strengths of each character.  
<br><br>
</li>

<li><strong>Mandated Variety:</strong>
<ul>
<li>Input: Mouse</li>
<li>Randomness: A lot of randomness</li>
<li>Play styles: Performer</li>
<li>Genre: Fighting </li>
</ul>
<br>
</li>

<li><strong>Prototype Goal:</strong>
With this game, I was evaluating turn-based playthroughs.  
<br><br>
</li>

<li><strong>Player Experience Goals:</strong>
I would like a player's experience with this game to be quick but enjoyable.  There are plenty of audio and visual stimulants, and anyone can win the game.    
<br><br>
</li>

<li><strong>Gameplay:</strong>
The actions a player can perform are very simple, and are all based on onscreen button clicks.  Each player has the option to either Attack, Defend, or Heal when it is their turn.  If a player attacks, they are able to do anywhere between 1 - 20 damage to the other player.  If a player heals, they are able to heal between 1 - 15 of their own HP.  If they choose to defend, their opponents next attack will only inflict 1/2 damage on them.
<br><br>
</li>

<li><strong>Strategies:</strong>
An effective strategy in this game would be to vary the amount of healing, attacking, and defending that is done.  A well-rounded approach is a great way to win a round.  
<br><br>
</li>

<li><strong>Story/Setting/Premise:</strong>
My story takes place in a strange world that Spongebob has never seen.  He woke up thrust into a fighting stage against a big, scary monster, and now must fight to survive.  
<br><br>
</li>

<li><strong>Target Audience:</strong>
The likely demographic of player's of this game are adults that were born in the 90's.  
<br><br>
</li>

<li><strong>Play Time:</strong>
This game could take anywhere from 30 seconds to 5 minutes to play.  The amount of time spent in the game is dependent on when one of the players reaches 0 HP.    
<br><br>
