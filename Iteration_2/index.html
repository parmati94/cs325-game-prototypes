<h2>Super Jumper 2: The Final Escape</h2>
<b>Note:</b> Game must be refreshed once or twice before playing, so that custom font displays correctly.  I'm not sure why this happens.  Additionally, I'd recommend a <b>chromium-based browser</b> be used for the best experience, as it significantly cuts down on the phaser bug where the player gets stuck running.<br>
<ul>
<li><strong>Originality:</strong>
My game is unique because it side-scrolling game, adds many space elements, and continues the story of my previous game. <br><br>


<li><strong>Technical Merit:</strong>
My game uses a vast horizontal landscape that is <b>significantly</b> larger than the game window itself.  This is accomplished through the use of repeated tileSprites and camera positioning.  My game includes strong audio and visual elements (including a player spritesheet) to create a cohesive and immersive theme.  Also, meteors are generated on a half second basis using a random x variable.  Finally, i've created a seamless playthrough experience - when the player is hit by an asteroid, the game simply restarts instead of ending (player position resets, all relevant objects are iterated through, removed, and re-placed).
<br><br>
</li>

<li><strong>Prototype Postmortem:</strong>
I feel like I learned quite a bit from making this prototype.  While I had previously worked with the camera and with objects beyond the scope of the game window, this prototype helped me become extremely familiar with the precise placement of objects. <br><br>

</li>

<li><strong>Prototype Assets:</strong>
The large starry background for my game and the platforms were made completely from scratch using Photoshop.  Also the win and "try again" voiceover's were done by me in Audacity. The other assets were sourced from a variety of places:
<ul>
<li>Player sprites: <a href="https://www.spriters-resource.com/pc_computer/amongus/sheet/139386/">Sprites</a></li>
<li>Background music: <a href="https://www.fesliyanstudios.com/royalty-free-music/">Ready to Fight</a></li>
<li>Bounce, pickup, breathe, meteor and hit sound effects: <a href="https://freesound.org/">Sound Effects</a></li>
<li>Oxygen, Meteors, and end-game light: <a href="https://pngtree.com/">PNGTree</a></li>
</ul>
<br>
</li>

<li><strong>Prototype Closest Other Game:</strong>
My game doesn't very closely resemble any other game, though you could make a case for it being similar to a classic Mario game since the game camera scrolls to the right and left.
</li>
<br><br>

<li><strong>High Concept:</strong>
Redblue Man is lost in a galaxy far far away - help him get back to his home planet in Super Jumper 2: The Final Escape!
<br><br>
</li>


<li><strong>Prototype Goal:</strong>
The core mechanic in this game is moving and jumping.  Careful adjustments had to be made to physics gravity and the jump velocity to ensure that both a) players are able to reach all platforms and b) jumping feels great when moving between platforms to pick up oxygen tanks.  
<br><br>
</li>

<li><strong>Player Experience Goals:</strong>
I'd like players to have an enjoyable experience playing my game, of course.  Idealy, the game immerses the player with it's audio visual elements, and also creates a building suspense as players collect more oxygen tanks and get closer to victory. 
<br><br>
</li>

<li><strong>Gameplay:</strong>
The actions a player can perform are relatively simple, and are all based off of the arrow keys on the keyboard.  A player is able to move left, right, and they are able jump. The player must collect all 25 oxygen tanks on the map while avoiding the incoming meteors.  After all oxygen tanks are collected, the exit (a large circle of light) appears on the right edge of the map - once the player reaches this, they win the game.  If the player is hit by an asteroid, the game restarts.      
<br><br>
</li>

<li><strong>Strategies:</strong>
An effective strategy in this game might be to spend more time at the top-most platforms of the map.  This enables the player to better see incoming meteors.<br><br>
</li>

<li><strong>Story/Setting/Premise:</strong>
My game takes place in a dark and unfamiliar galaxy.  The protagonist, Red-Blue Man, has lost his way home after searching the galaxies for new life-forms.  In the game, he finds his way home by collecting all of the oxygen on the map and escaping to the white light.<br> 

I believe that the combination of the backstory with the audio and visual elements creates a unique and interesting experience for players.
<br><br>
</li>

<li><strong>Target Audience:</strong>
The likely demographic of player's of this game anyone from the ages of 6 to 50 years old.  
<br><br>
</li>

<li><strong>Play Time:</strong>
This game should take around 3 to 5 minutes to complete.  This could be significantly extended by the player continuously being hit by asteroids
